                <h2>What is Facial Recognition Technology?</h2>
                <p>Facial recognition technology (FRT) is a biometric artificial intelligence system that identifies or verifies individuals by analyzing facial features from images or video footage. The technology works through several key steps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Face Detection:</strong> The system locates human faces in images or video frames.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> It maps facial characteristics (e.g., distance between eyes, jawline shape, nose structure) to create a unique facial signature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Comparison:</strong> The facial signature is compared against databases of known faces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Matching & Identification:</strong> The system returns potential matches with confidence scores.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Modern FRT systems use deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have dramatically improved accuracy in recent years. However, these systems still struggle with consistent performance across different demographics.</p>

                <h2>Why Does Facial Recognition Matter?</h2>
                <p>The rapid adoption of facial recognition technology raises critical concerns that demand public attention:</p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <div>
                        <h3>Privacy Violations</h3>
                        <p>Mass surveillance capabilities enable tracking individuals without consent in public and private spaces. Unlike other identifiers, faces cannot be easily changed or concealed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Racial & Gender Bias</h3>
                        <p>Studies consistently show higher error rates for women and people of color. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found some algorithms were up to 100 times more likely to misidentify Asian and Black faces compared to white faces.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Government Overreach</h3>
                        <p>Authoritarian regimes like China use FRT for social control and oppression of ethnic minorities. Even in democracies, expanded surveillance powers threaten civil liberties.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>We chose to examine this technology because its deployment is accelerating worldwide while regulatory frameworks lag behind, creating an urgent need for public awareness and policy intervention.</p>
